Okay!

so, when I made the code at college, APPARENTLY since I wasn't able to test it I didn't debug it right, meaning the code didn't work. HOW EMBARASSING!

NOW IT WORKS!

The usage is the same as before:

```
# make sure you place pyspeak.py and __init__.py into the same folder as the program you would like to use it in.
from pyspeak import speak

speak("Helo world!")
```

made this for a few future projects (like a server + speaker AI assistant coming soon.)

use it however you want, don't care. unless it's malware, but you skiddie fucks don't care if the code you use to make malware permits you to or not lol.
